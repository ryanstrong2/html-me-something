            <p>Modern society separates people by class.  Within these classes
                there are many sublevels.  From my point of view people in higher
                classes than mine treat the lower classes as if their value is
                also lower.
            </p>

            <p>It seems many people are secure or comfortable in the class they
                are born into.  Each person plays a role in the world economy.
                If there are not trash collectors, disease spreads.
                With out farmers there is no food.  Many professions are paid
                the skill required not the importance to society.</p>

            <p>If the wealth of the world was evenly distributed each person would
                earn about $40000 per year.
                $80,900,000,000,000 in currency around the world
                  7,400,000,000 people alive on Earth
                        $10,900 per person
                    </p>


            <p>A redistribution like this would result in major resistance from
                everyone with greater wealth.  I am surprised that most people have
                far less than this and do not resist the current imbalance.  Also
                surprising is the hope of having a greater sum of money even with
                very low chance leads people to support this imbalance.
